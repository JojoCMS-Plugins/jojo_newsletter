Basic tips for preventing being marked as spam:

1. Setup a SPF record for your domain. Read and understand this at http://www.openspf.org/ and then use the wizard at http://old.openspf.org
2. If you are including images in your newsletters, make sure you use a decent amount of text. Spam filters don't like emails with just images.
3. Use a decent subject. Avoid obvious words that are likely to flag the message as spam eg "FREE STUFF INSIDE!!!!!!!".
